websites and resources that I used for this project came form w3school, copyright free stock images with creative commons attributions and I tried to re-write the code wherever possible. for 
the code itself i just remebered to add comments to each section of the code. My failure to do so in the early parts of the project did cause some confusion for me later 
in the project and also for anyone who might see the code. I treat it as a learning experience and now with the lesson I learned from this project i feel pretty good to do another project ike this.
